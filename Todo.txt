- Add remove talk functionality
- Construct metadata from talk note database
- Is there a way to save unsaved input if e.g. computer crashes while editing?
- Check for existing talk file before creating new one and handle appropriately (i.e. mismatch between database and metadata)
- Handle multiple people with the same name
- Be more careful about processing input for things that might cause issues
